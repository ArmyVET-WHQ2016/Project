                        <h2>My Bio</h2>
                        
                        Hello, everyone! My name is Wendy Hamiltonquinn. I am a U.S Army disable veteran, I currently take residence
                        in the state of Georgia. I hold a two degree one in Nursing and another in General Studies with science
                        concentration.
                        I decided to become a Nurse Practitional back many years before the pandemic hit. But unfortunately, that
                        goal for me has
                        changed. I enjoy helping others and learning difficult things which " I believe keeps the mind stimulated".
                        My employment
                        history stems from government. I have taken on a few opportunities to serve in a different manner. I
                        currently with the
                        Internal Revenue Service as a Perfection Remittance Clerk in Atlanta, Georgia. Some of my short term
                        goals are to first
                        leave the IRS, focus on relaxation and meditation, and start a new career in the technology industry as a
                        Software Developer. My long term goal
                        is to get back out there and travel on weekend getaways, retreats, and vacation "you name it.</p>
